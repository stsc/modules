    tests

SYNOPSIS
     use Math::Prime::XS ':all';
     # or
     use Math::Prime::XS qw(is_prime primes mod_primes sieve_primes sum_primes trial_primes);

     @range_primes = primes(30, 70);

     @all_primes   = mod_primes(100);
     @range_primes = mod_primes(30, 70);

     @all_primes   = sieve_primes(100);
     @range_primes = sieve_primes(30, 70);

     @all_primes   = sum_primes(100);
     @range_primes = sum_primes(30, 70);

     @all_primes   = trial_primes(100);
     @range_primes = trial_primes(30, 70);

DESCRIPTION
    `Math::Prime::XS' detects and calculates prime numbers by either
    applying Modulo operator division, the Sieve of Eratosthenes, a
    Summation calculation or Trial division.

FUNCTIONS
  is_prime

     is_prime($number);

    Returns true if the number is prime, false if not.

    The XS function invoked within `is_prime()' is subject to change
    (currently `xs_sieve_primes()').

  primes

     @all_primes   = primes($number);
     @range_primes = primes($base, $number);

    Returns all primes for the given number or primes between the base and
    number.

    The resolved function called is subject to change (currently
    `sieve_primes()').

  mod_primes

     @all_primes   = mod_primes($number);
     @range_primes = mod_primes($base, $number);

    Applies the Modulo operator division algorithm:

    Divide the number by all numbers less or equal than itself; if the
    number is divided exactly two times by the modulo operator without rest,
    then the number is prime.

    Returns all primes for the given number or primes between the base and
    number.

  sieve_primes

     @all_primes   = sieve_primes($number);
     @range_primes = sieve_primes($base, $number);

    Applies the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm:

    One of the most efficient ways to find all the small primes (say, all
    those less than 10,000,000) is by using the Sieve of Eratosthenes (ca
    240 BC). Make a list of all numbers less than or equal to n (and greater
    than one) and strike out the multiples of all primes less than or equal
    to the square root of n: the numbers that are left are primes.

    Returns all primes for the given number or primes between the base and
    number.

  sum_primes

     @all_primes   = sum_primes($number);
     @range_primes = sum_primes($base, $number);

    Applies the Summation calculation algorithm:

    The summation calculation algorithm resembles the modulo operator
    division algorithm, but also shares some common properties with the
    Sieve of Eratosthenes. For each saved prime smaller than or equal to the
    square root of the number, recall the corresponding sum (if none, start
    with zero); add the prime to the sum being calculated while the
    summation is smaller than the number. If none of the sums equals the
    number, then the number is prime.

    Returns all primes for the given number or primes between the base and
    number.

  trial_primes

     @all_primes   = trial_primes($number);
     @range_primes = trial_primes($base, $number);

    Applies the Trial division algorithm:

    To see if an individual small number is prime, trial division works
    well: just divide by all the primes less than or equal to its square
    root. For example, to assert 211 is prime, divide by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 and
    13. Since none of these primes divides the number evenly, it is prime.

    Returns all primes for the given number or primes between the base and
    number.

BENCHMARK
    Following output resulted from a benchmark measuring the time to
    calculate primes up to 1,000,000 with 100 iterations for each function.
    The tests were conducted by the `cmpthese' function of the Benchmark
    module.

BUGS & CAVEATS
    Note that the order of execution speed for functions may differ from the
    benchmarked results when numbers get larger or smaller.
